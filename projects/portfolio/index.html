            <p>If you honestly wanted to know anything else about me, August, a web developer from Atlanta, GA.</p>
            <p>I'm primarily self-taught, with the gracious help of a pretty decent older brother as well as a community
                called #100Devs. My degree is in healthcare, but my passion lies in staring at a monitor. In truth, I'd
                love to impact the healthcare field positively by improving their processes and software efficiency.</p>
            <p>I enjoy Adobe Illustrator, binging Kurzgesagt videos, hiking, and old cartoons (especially golden age).
                Big fan of spicy food, nostalgia, and RuPaul's Drag Race.</p>
